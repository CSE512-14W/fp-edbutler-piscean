    <h1>Visualizing Progressions for Education and Game Design</h1>

    <p>This project is an interactive visualization of <em>progressions</em> from games. It allows for two progressions from the same game to be compared.</p>
    This is important because it lets game designers ask important questions about their game without having to playtest and re-design in a labor-intensive loop.
    While playtesting is critical and irreplaceable, certain insights can be gleaned by visualizing progressions in a tool like ours. For instance:
    <ul>
    <li>How does the concept ordering compare across two progressions?</li>
    <li>How does the complexity change over the progression? </li>
    <li>How much of the "design space" is covered by one progression, but not the other? i.e., does one progression neglect some concepts or combinations thereof?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How to Run</h2>

    <p>The program is web-based, but requires a python web server backend to do the MDS computation. The primary python packages it requires are:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> </li>
      <li> numpy </li>
      <li> scipy </li>
      <li> matplotlib </li>
      <li> <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> </li>
    </ul>
    These packages are all available in pip, and can be installed with:
    <pre>
    pip install -r req.txt
    </pre>

    The entry point is:
    <pre>
    src/main.py
    </pre>

    It will launch a webserver on:
    <pre>
    localhost:5000
    </pre></p>

    <p>So, for example, on a recent ubuntu distro, the program can be setup and run with:
    <pre>
    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
    virtualenv venv/
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r req.txt
    cd src/
    ./main.py
    </pre>
    Then, in a browser, open:
    <pre>
    http://localhost:5000/
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>Several datasets are included in:
    <pre>
    src/data/
    </pre>
    The main page has links to a few interesting example comparisons.
    The last link ("pick datasets manually") lets the user select datasets from a dropdown (automatically generated by scanning the data folder)</p>

    <h2>Example Use Case</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> Load up the "Refraction (original vs. generated)" dataset </li>
    <li> Under the "Controls" on the left-hand side, in the drop-down list called "Sort By:", select the "#1 Intro Order". This sorts the concepts in the two grids according to order of appearance in the first progression </li>
    <li> Under the "Controls" on the left-hand side, in the drop-down list called "Filter To:", select the "num_splitter". The grid views are replaced with the details of the "num_splitter" concept across the two progressions. Multiple concepts can be (de)selected by holding down the "Control" (or "Command" on Mac) key while clicking them.</li>
    <li> Clear the selection(s) by clicking the "Clear Filters" button on the bottom left. This hides the bar charts and shows the grid views.</li>
    </ul>
